# SCAnalyzer
SCAnalyzer is a tiny web service that bridges the gap between SouncCloud and the Echo Nest. With the SCAnalyzer you can get the detailed Echo Nest analysis for any SoundCloud track given the track's ID, URN or URL.

The web service is staged at: [labs.echonest.com/SCAnalyzer](http://labs.echonest.com/SCAnalyzer) where you will find the full docs.

Built in preparation for [Music Hack Day Helsinki](http://helsinki.musichackday.org).
